<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


I have built an Course Registration System to help Education plateforms or schools. After taking classes from college, I realized that I can help make the regirstation process more user friendly, therefore I came up with this project.

Here's why:
* The course registration system at Emory was hard to use. The user interface was not up to date and I had trouble using it.
* I have also seen other students struggle with the systems in their school and I want to help other students as well.
